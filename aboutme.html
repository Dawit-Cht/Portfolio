            <p>
                I'm working as an DevSecOp Engineer, though my career seem to not relate about this field. Actually, it has some part in common such as UX/UI design since my job is creating a dashboard for monitoring and visualize data. I studied many courses on the internet to improve my skill as a frontend developer. Currently I focus on React framework to improve this portfolio showcase because it develops by using only native HTML, CSS and JavaScripts.

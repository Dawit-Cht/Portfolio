            "projectDescription": "Portfolio was developed by using HTML, CSS and JS. First I designed this project using Figma, so most of the interface will be similar to these design. After I start writng real web applicaiton and see each detail. It will have some change that different from the design in Figma. I use css grid to manage overall layout of the page since I want to manage it as rows and columns. This project was designed to allow me to try as much as possible about basic of the web application development though it may use only a little JavaScript. I plan to improve it more in the future for both design and funtion. I also plan to rewrite this project by using React,other libraries and tools to explore and improve my skill as a frontend web developer.",

Based on the requirement for this web applciation, I found some useful guide from Youtube chanel called \"The Stoic Programmers\". I didn't clone git and use it right away, but I start from create React application then follow guidde step by step. There are multiple bugs since I didn't follow the guide perfectly. Somehow I made it in the end.",

I strat develop it from scratch by using \"npx create-react-app\" then follow the youtube video to writing each component also testing something for me to learn more about React. It's quite hard because I don't have any basic fo React. It was my first journey for web developing and make me interest in developing web applciation. simpleLogin use react-tostify and react-router-dom as a main libraries to make this app look more real like a login page. React application will connect to NodeJS running as a backend to perform function to crate, register, and login through SQL database. I use NodeJS as a backend to develop RESTFUL API application.",

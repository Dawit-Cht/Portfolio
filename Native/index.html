                        <span class="tab"></span>This is my first project that I start from scratch. It may not be the begin of my career path in this field, but it is one of my pround to present project. This project will be my portfolio to show my experience with the skill that I used for developing this portfolio. It was developed by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript without any framework or libraries to help me understand web application from the basic before start using other tools.

                        <span class="tab"></span>Portfolio was developed by using HTML, CSS and JS. First I designed this project using Figma, so most of the interface will be similar to these design. After I start writng real web applicaiton and see each detail. It has some change that different from the design in Figma. I use CSS Grid to manage overall layout of the page since I want to manage it as rows and columns. This project was designed to allow me to try as much as possible about basic of the web application development though it may use only a little JavaScript. I plan to improve it more in the future for both design and funtion. I also plan to rewrite this project by using React, other libraries and tools to explore and improve my skill as a frontend web developer.

                        <span class="tab"></span>This project is a web application for testing security tools. I used React for frontend, NodeJs for backend and PostgresSQL as a databased. Based on the requirement for this web applciation, I found some useful guide from Youtube channel called "<a class="ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UQBMb8ZpuE">The Stoic Programmers</a>". I didn't clone git and use it right away, but I start from create React application then follow guide step by step. There are multiple bugs since I didn't follow the guide perfectly. Somehow I made it in the end.

                        <span class="tab"></span>I develop this application for testing security tools. I start develop it from scratch by using "npx create-react-app" then follow the youtube video to writing each component also testing something for me to learn more about React. It's quite hard because I don't have any basic fo React. It was my first journey for web developing and make me interest in developing web applciation. simpleLogin use react-tostify and react-router-dom as a main libraries to make this app look more realistic like a login page. React application will connect to NodeJS running as a backend to perform function to crate, register, and login through SQL database. I use NodeJS as a backend to develop RESTFUL API application.

It is not related to web application, but I would like to put in my portfolio because This is all my work as a DevSecOps Engineer. I spent most of my time to develop, design, and improve the dashboard to delivery some analyzed information to the users. The dashboard was designed as a template, so it was used in multiple projects. Although it may look different for each final result, it still based on sames template.

I created a template dashboard for monitoring build pipeline for tracking the vulnerabilities for each project or application by using Elasticscearch with Kibana or Grafana. This project help me improve skill in UX/UI design since it shows what customers see. I start with the template and reuse the dashboard multiple times. Final products for each customer is different based on their requirements. I want to show more about the template that was used and the final product for each customer, but it was used internal. It isn't good for me to bring it out, so I hope you understandüôè.

                        <span class="tab"></span>This project is a web application for testing security tools. I used React Framework for frontend, NodeJs for backend and PostgresSQL as a databased. Based on the requirement for this web applciation, I found some useful guide from Youtube chanel called "<a class="ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UQBMb8ZpuE">The Stoic Programmers</a>". I didn't clone git and use it right away, but I start from create React application then follow guidde step by step. There are multiple bugs since I didn't follow the guide perfectly. Somehow I made it in the end.

                    <p>
                        <span class="tab"></span>This is my work as a DevSecOps Engineer. It is not related to web application, but I would like to put in my portfolio because This is all my work as a DevSecOps Engineer. I spent most of my time to develop, design, and improve the dashboard to delivery some analyzed information to the users. The dashboard was designed as a template, so it was used in multiple projects. Although it varies since it may be created by different applciation, it still based on sames template.
